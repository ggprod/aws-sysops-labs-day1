# Lab 1: Using AWS Systems Manager
In this lab you'll explore and practice using the AWS Systems Manager to manage your AWS resources

## Task 1:  Generating Inventory lists for Managed Instances
You can use the Systems Manager Inventory to collect operating system, application, and instance metadata from your Amazon EC2 instances and your on-premises servers or virtual machines in your hybrid environment. You can query the metadata to quickly understand which instances are running the software and configurations required by your software policy, and which instances need to be updated.

1. In the **Services** menu (in the **Management and Governance** section) click the **Systems Manager**
