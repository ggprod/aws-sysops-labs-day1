# Lab 3: Using Auto Scaling in AWS
In this lab you will create an AMI from an EC2 instance (that you have configured with the software you want) and then use that AMI
in an Auto Scaling Group that will scale up and down with load.  You will test the group by connecting to it through an Elastic Load
Balancer
